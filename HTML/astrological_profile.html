The One Outfit Your Zodiac Sign Should Wear This Fall
</center>


Sure your horoscope says you'll need a lot of hot looks this season, but our astrologer-and-stylist team
found the single best one for getting.
What You Really Want !!!!!!

Holy sh*t, guys—you’re going to have a great fall.

There are tons of astrological reasons why 
(we’ll get to that in a minute, but it has to do <br>
with the fact that Jupiter,
the luckiest planet—is hanging out in Sagittarius<br>
 for the rest of the year;
 plus, a few retrogrades are finally bowing out, thank God).
 
To capitalize on this momentous time for literally everyone, we put Jake Register of Jake’s Astrology to work<br>
 with our fashion team to find your luckiest look for your peak fall moment.<br>
 
 
    <center><h3 >We’ve just about hit the midsummer slump: that time <br>
	every year when our new, warm-weather pieces just don’t seem<br>
	as fun as they did when we first took them home from the store.<br>
	We still love our off-the-shoulder tops, choker<br> 
	necklaces, cutoff shorts, and collection of bomber jackets,<br>
	but we also yearn for new ways to style our old favorites. <br>
	A suggestion? Look to the stars. Your next summer go-to <br>
	may already be written in the sky. Scroll through the <br>
	slideshow for 30 midsummer outfit ideas based on your sign.<br>
	From the risk-taking Leo to the elegant Virgo,<br>
	we've got your summer style horoscope covered.</h3></center>

	<h1 style="color:yellow">        AQUARIUS   </h1><br>
	<img src="images/d1.jpeg" width="300px" height="400px"/><br>
	You’re creative and original, marching to the beat of your own drum.<br>	
   While you have an eye for fashion and know all about the biggest trends <br>
   of the season, they mean nothing to you when it comes to what you choose to wear. <br>
   You know what you like and rock all your favorite pieces like few others can.<br><br><br>

	<img src="images/d2.jpeg" width="300px" height="400px"/><br>
	Keep it simple with jean shorts, but add fun details like a <br>
	sweatshirt around your waist or a pair of killer heels.<br><br><br><br>
	
	<h1 style="color:yellow">CANCER</h1>
	<img src="images/d3.jpeg" width="300px" height="400px"/><br>
	You know what you like, and you stick to it. That doesn’t mean you <br>
	gravitate toward boring pieces, though. After all, classics are just <br>
	our favorite essentials, and they’re anything but stuffy. When packing <br>
	your bag for a summer getaway, you can’t imagine leaving your wardrobe <br>
	staples behind: vintage tees, denim shorts, and low-top sneakers all the way.<br><br><br>
	
	<img src="images/d5.jpeg" width="300px" height="400px"/><br>
	Bring back the denim mini this summer (and straight into fall)<br>
	by pairing it with a tank and ankle booties.<br><br><br><br>
	
	<h1 style="color:yellow">LIO</h1>
	<img src="images/d22.jpeg" width="300px" height="400px"/><br>
	You’re independent and self-sufficient…until you’re not. <br>
	You’re the girl who busts out of the house in a head-turning <br>
	look, guns blazing, but needs a little bit of an audience once<br>
	you’re outside. (Hey…we’re not judging! Everyone loves to be <br>
	told how awesome they look from time to time!) You keep your look<br>
	classic but make sure to have a totally bold piece or<br>
	two to make people stare<br><br>
	
	<img src="images/d8.jpeg" width="300px" height="400px"/><br>
	Sometimes it's as simple as a bright pop of color in a bag or accessory.<br><br>
	<img src="images/d21.jpeg" width="300px" height="400px"/><br>
	Pull out all the stops when it comes to your jumpsuit: Try <br>
	sheer details, a statement bow, and accessorize with strappy heels.<br><br><br><br>
	
	
	<h1 style="color:yellow">VIRGO</h1>
	<img src="images/d7.jpeg" width="300px" height="400px"/><br>
	You’re powerful but indecisive at times. While you may need <br>
	a little push to convince you that you're on the best path, <br>
	you know—deep down—you were right all along. <br>
	Your fashion choices mirror your temperament as you <br>
	keep it simple, but look for details that make you smile.<br><br>
	
	<img src="images/d6.jpeg" width="300px" height="400px"/><br>
	Add a little flair with a ruffle or off-the-shoulder <br>
	style instead of reaching for traditional shirting.<br><br>
	
	<img src="images/d20.jpeg" width="300px" height="400px"/><br>
	Let your top do the talking, amping up your go-to <br>
	skinny-jeans look with a bit of flair.<br><br><br><br>
	
	<h1 style="color:yellow">LIBRA</h1>
	<img src="images/d9.jpeg" width="300px" height="400px"/><br>
	You’re a little laid-back from time to time, but never when<br>
	it comes to your fashion. While you may have dreams of a bright <br>
	future, the journey to get there seems so long. In the meantime?<br>
	You look the part: always pulled together and always dressed to the nines.<br><br>
	
	<img src="images/d19.jpeg" width="300px" height="400px"/><br>
	Layer with the classics, like a leather or denim jacket<br><br>
	
	<img src="images/d18.jpeg" width="300px" height="400px"/><br>
	Channel Grace Kelly in a tea-length strapless dress for an evening event<br><br><br><br>
	
	<h1 style="color:yellow">SCORPIO</h1>
	<img src="images/d17.jpeg" width="300px" height="400px"/><br>
	You’re a true Queen Bey: an independent woman who not only <br>
	knows she is but seriously flaunts it. You don’t need the <br>
	craziest trend or boldest statement accessory to show the <br>
	world who’s boss. You’re set with an LBD and a pair of killer heels.<br><br>
	
	<img src="images/d16.jpeg" width="300px" height="400px"/><br>
	Go for that ever-trendy '90s style with a simple slip dress and ankle booties.<br><br><br><br>
	
	
	<h1 style="color:yellow">SAGITTARIUS</h1>
	<img src="images/d23.jpeg" width="300px" height="400px"/><br>
	You’re more adventurous than anyone you know, but totally <BR>
	easygoing no matter what situation comes your way. Your look <br>
	reflects your carefree attitude: bright, bold, and always comfortable.<br><br>
	
	<img src="images/d24.jpeg" width="300px" height="400px"/><br>
	Add a pair of whimsical heels to an elevated athleisure look.<br><br><br><br>
	
	
	<h1 style="color:yellow">CAPRICORNN</h1>
		<img src="images/d15.jpeg" width="300px" height="400px"/><br>
		You’re independent, but in a way that leads you to support <br>
		those around you. You’re always put-together; you make heads <br>
		turn and friends wonder how they can cop your impeccable style.<br>
		As such,
		your wardrobe is filled to the brim with the classics:<br>
		ankle-cropped denim, crisp white shirting, loafers, the works.<br><br>
		
		
			<img src="images/d14.jpeg" width="300px" height="400px"/><br>
			Go for a long-line coat in a bright color to top off your jeans and T-shirt look.<br><br>
			
				<img src="images/d13.jpeg" width="300px" height="400px"/><br>
				Modernize your lace outfit by opting for a slip dress and accessorizing <br>
				with chunky-heeled mules.<br><br><br><br>
	
	
	
	
	
	<h1 style="color:yellow">PISCES</h1>
		<img src="images/d11.jpeg" width="300px" height="400px"/><br>
		You’re a little bit of a dreamer, often finding your head stuck<br>
		in the clouds. No matter: It’s a great place to be when it<br>
		comes to fashion! Your style is wood nymph meets hippie meets<br>
		effervescent fashionista. If only you were born in the ‘60s<br><br>
		
			<img src="images/d12.jpeg" width="300px" height="400px"/><br>
			Show a little skin with your boho outfit by opting for a crop<br>
			top and high-waisted style.<br><br><br><br>

	
	
	
	<h1 style="color:yellow">ARIES</h1>
		<img src="images/d10.jpeg" width="300px" height="400px"/><br>
		You’re a go-getter and totally independent, which translates<br>
		into a try-anything attitude when it comes to your clothing.<br>
		You’re the first one to wear even the craziest of runway trends<br>
		IRL, and you know you look awesome doing it. What’s fashion if not fun?
		<br><br><br><br>
			
	
	
	
	<h1 style="color:yellow">TARUS</h1>
	
		<img src="images/d8.jpeg" width="300px" height="400px"/><br>
		You’re independent, but never the first one out of the gate<br>
		when it comes to venturing into the great unknown.You may wait<br>
		until midseason to jump into any of the newest trends,<br>
		but once you find them, too much is never enough.<br><br>
		
			<img src="images/d7.jpeg" width="300px" height="400px"/><br>
			Try out the sheer trend, but keep it refined with a longer, high-neck silhouette.<br><br><br><br>
	
	<h1 style="color:yellow">GIMINI</h1>

		<img src="images/d27.jpeg" width="300px" height="400px"/><br>	
		You can’t imagine not exercising your God-given right to be <br>
		your own person. You're extremely independent but also quite<br>
		stubborn — there’s no question you make everything in your <br>
		wardrobe your own. You mix and match trends with fervor and <br>
		thoroughly enjoy every moment of the reckless abandonment with which you get dressed<br><br>
		
		<img src="images/d26.jpeg" width="300px" height="400px"/><br>
		Mix prints and colors in tailored silhouettes for a fun yet elegant look.
